# PUBLICITY: voice-agent-lab (P18)

Publicity log under the documentation and publishing standard,
Section 7. Every finished level produces its written fan-out set,
each piece graded on the 1,000-point publicity rubric (accuracy 300,
research 200, gap fit 200, clarity 150, reach format 150), ship line
900. Drafts are prepared by the loop. Actual social posting follows
the standing platform rules and gates. The loop itself never posts
to social.

Project state: v1.0, Learn, Build, and Deep done 2026-11-05,
70 tests passing plus the scaffold smoke test. Level grades on
record: Learn 8,500 of 10,000, Build 7,500 of 10,000,
Deep 7,700 of 10,000.

## Actions polish pack (2026-11-05)

Applied through a pull request on 2026-11-05, following the Actions
polish pack standard. The pack adds: CI on a Python 3.11 and 3.12
matrix with a ruff lint step (the pre-existing CI step preserved:
scaffold smoke test; plus per-level test and runner steps for Learn,
Build, and Deep, following the proven pack pattern), CodeQL
scanning, Dependabot for pip and GitHub Actions, a release workflow
that attaches a source tarball named
voice-agent-lab-<tag>.tar.gz to v* tag releases, Labeler,
Greetings (snake_case inputs for actions/first-interaction@v3:
repo_token, issue_message, pr_message), Stale in comment-only mode
(days-before-close: -1, never closes), and a docs summary page at
docs/index.md for GitHub Pages. Ruff scope is recorded in
ruff.toml (E, F, I, line-length 120). Ruff fixes in this pull
request were style only: 10 initial errors (all I001 import order
or format), fixed by ruff fix output, with no change to behaviour,
to any imported name that is used, or to any string value. The
Build results file stayed byte-identical across the runners; the
Learn and Deep results files differed only in their timing fields,
which are excluded from their determinism checks, and those
timing-only diffs were restored. requirements.txt records the
standard-library-only fact so Dependabot pip has a manifest
to watch.

| Channel | Outcome on 2026-11-05 |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub Pages | Docs page added at docs/index.md in this pull request. Pages enablement and live build status are verified after merge and recorded in the batch ledger; no live claim is made in this file before that check. |
| PyPI publishing | Held: needs a PyPI token, a new credential. Jesun's tap only. Not set up. |
| Social channels (LinkedIn, X, Facebook, Instagram, Threads) | Held: no posts made. The loop never posts to social; Threads waits for Jesun's tap per post under the standing gates. |

Publicity grade for this polish pack log piece, on the 1,000
point rubric (accuracy 300, research 200, gap fit 200, clarity
150, reach format 150), ship line 900:

| Piece | Accuracy /300 | Research /200 | Gap fit /200 | Clarity /150 | Reach /150 | Total /1000 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PUBLICITY.md polish pack section (2026-11-05) | 295 | 180 | 195 | 145 | 95 | 910 |

At or above the 900 ship line. Named deductions: research minus
20, because the pack is a standard applied across repos and this
section records its application rather than new research; reach
minus 55, because the docs page is copy in this pull request with
no live Pages claim yet, PyPI publishing is held, and no social
channel carries this piece by the standing gates; accuracy minus
5, gap fit minus 5, and clarity minus 5 for summary compression
of the full pack standard, which lives in the batch files.

## v1.0 fan-out set (2026-11-05)

Written fan-out set prepared in this cycle, in fanout/. Every
piece states plainly that there is no real ASR model, no real
TTS voice, and no LLM in any level, that speech in is text
transcripts or transcript partials, that speech out is text or
tone WAV with no intelligible speech, that the answer step is a
keyword rule over a fixed teaching knowledge base, that every
case set is synthetic and authored for this project, and that
the Deep cloud side is modelled from stated constants only,
never measured. Every number is sourced from the repo files
(README.md, DOSSIER.md, the three level READMEs, and the three
results files). Tutorial commands were verified by running
them; the full suite (70 tests plus the scaffold smoke test)
passes and the Build results file stayed byte-identical across
the runners, with the Learn and Deep results files differing
only in timing fields and restored.

Overall fan-out grade: 9,457 of 10,000 (the mean of the six
piece grades below, scaled to 10,000: 5,674 of 6,000).

Jev claim_check on the blog main results claim (extracted byte
exact from fanout/blog-post.md by script): model jev-1.13.0,
822 input tokens, question id supported, noul 0.55, route
REVIEW (claim_check bands: clear at 0.85 or above, block at
0.10 or below, review between). Spec and results are in the
goal hidden_files (jev-p18-fanout-claim-spec-2026-11-05.json
and jev-p18-fanout-claim-results-2026-11-05.json).

| Repo (blog) | Blog post draft | fanout/blog-post.md, repo draft. Not posted to any blog platform. |
| Repo (tutorial) | Tutorial draft | fanout/tutorial.md, repo draft. Every command verified by running it in this cycle. |
| Repo (website) | Website page copy draft | fanout/website-page.md, copy only. No website was changed by this file. |
| LinkedIn | Post draft | fanout/linkedin-post.md, DRAFT NOT POSTED. Held: posting follows the standing platform rules; the link is carried as the first-comment line in the draft, per the LinkedIn rule. |
| Paper | Candidate brief | fanout/paper-candidate.md. Submission is Jesun's tap; nothing submitted, no venue contacted. |
| Repo (release notes) | Release notes | fanout/release-notes.md, covering v0.1, v0.5, and v1.0 with measured results and release links verified with gh release list. |
| X | Social post | Held: no post made. The loop never posts to social; drafts only under the standing platform rules. |
| Facebook | Social post | Held: no post made. Standing Facebook rule applies (no link in body or comments, keyword call to action by DM) and the loop never posts to social. |
| Instagram | Social post | Held: no post made. Standing Instagram rule applies (link in bio) and the loop never posts to social. |
| Threads | Social post | Held: awaiting Jesun's tap. Every Threads post needs his one-tap pre-approval, hash-locked on exact text and media. |
| Video | 3D playbook video | Held: flagship video production runs through the January engine queue. No video produced in this cycle. |
| Book | Book chapter | Held: chapter drafted from finished projects under the journey publishing plan; no chapter file is claimed in this cycle. |

Per-piece publicity grades, on the 1,000-point rubric (accuracy
300, research 200, gap fit 200, clarity 150, reach format 150),
ship line 900:

| Piece | Accuracy /300 | Research /200 | Gap fit /200 | Clarity /150 | Reach /150 | Total /1000 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| fanout/blog-post.md | 295 | 185 | 195 | 143 | 137 | 955 |
| fanout/tutorial.md | 298 | 182 | 195 | 148 | 135 | 958 |
| fanout/website-page.md | 295 | 175 | 190 | 145 | 140 | 945 |
| fanout/linkedin-post.md | 290 | 170 | 190 | 143 | 145 | 938 |
| fanout/paper-candidate.md | 295 | 188 | 192 | 140 | 120 | 935 |
| fanout/release-notes.md | 298 | 180 | 185 | 145 | 135 | 943 |
| PUBLICITY.md fan-out section (this section) | 295 | 175 | 190 | 145 | 130 | 935 |

All six fan-out pieces are at or above the 900 ship line. Named
deductions: accuracy loses 2 to 10 per piece for summary
compression of the level READMEs (the full method, per-case
tables, and failure modes live in the level folders, not in the
fan-out pieces); research loses 12 to 30 per piece because the
fan-out reports measured repo work and names prior art from
DOSSIER.md and NOVELTY.md rather than adding new external
research, and the paper brief names no venue; gap fit loses 5
to 15 per piece because the synthetic authored sets, the
keyword rule answer step, and the sine-loop synthesis cap how
far any piece can speak to real voice agent roles; clarity
loses 2 to 10 per piece for the repeated scope lines (no ASR,
no TTS voice, no LLM, modelled cloud), which are mandatory
honesty and cost reading flow; reach loses 5 to 30 per piece
because every social channel is held under the standing gates,
the paper is an unsubmitted brief, and no live website or blog
publication exists yet, so reach is draft reach, not published
reach.
