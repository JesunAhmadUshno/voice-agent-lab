# Publicity log: voice-agent-lab (P18)

Publicity log under the documentation and publishing standard,
Section 7. Every finished level produces its written fan-out set.
Drafts are prepared by the loop. Actual social posting follows
the standing platform rules and gates. The loop itself never posts
to social.

Project state: v1.0, Learn, Build, and Deep done 2026-11-05,
70 tests passing plus the scaffold smoke test. (Moved here from
PUBLICITY.md on 2026-11-08; publicity rubric scores and level grades
are internal under the portfolio standard v2.)

## Actions polish pack (2026-11-05)

Applied through a pull request on 2026-11-05, following the Actions
polish pack standard. The pack adds: CI on a Python 3.11 and 3.12
matrix with a ruff lint step (the pre-existing CI step preserved:
scaffold smoke test; plus per-level test and runner steps for Learn,
Build, and Deep, following the proven pack pattern), CodeQL
scanning, Dependabot for pip and GitHub Actions, a release workflow
that attaches a source tarball named
voice-agent-lab-<tag>.tar.gz to v* tag releases, Labeler,
Greetings (snake_case inputs for actions/first-interaction@v3:
repo_token, issue_message, pr_message), Stale in comment-only mode
(days-before-close: -1, never closes), and a docs summary page at
docs/index.md for GitHub Pages. Ruff scope is recorded in
ruff.toml (E, F, I, line-length 120). Ruff fixes in this pull
request were style only: 10 initial errors (all I001 import order
or format), fixed by ruff fix output, with no change to behaviour,
to any imported name that is used, or to any string value. The
Build results file stayed byte-identical across the runners; the
Learn and Deep results files differed only in their timing fields,
which are excluded from their determinism checks, and those
timing-only diffs were restored. requirements.txt records the
standard-library-only fact so Dependabot pip has a manifest
to watch.

| Channel | Outcome on 2026-11-05 |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub Pages | Docs page added at docs/index.md in this pull request. Pages enablement and live build status are verified after merge and recorded in the batch ledger; no live claim is made in this file before that check. |
| PyPI publishing | Held: needs a PyPI token, a new credential. Jesun's tap only. Not set up. |
| Social channels (LinkedIn, X, Facebook, Instagram, Threads) | Held: no posts made. The loop never posts to social; Threads waits for Jesun's tap per post under the standing gates. |

## v1.0 fan-out set (2026-11-05)

Written fan-out set prepared in this cycle, in fanout/. Every
piece states plainly that there is no real ASR model, no real
TTS voice, and no LLM in any level, that speech in is text
transcripts or transcript partials, that speech out is text or
tone WAV with no intelligible speech, that the answer step is a
keyword rule over a fixed teaching knowledge base, that every
case set is synthetic and authored for this project, and that
the Deep cloud side is modelled from stated constants only,
never measured. Every number is sourced from the repo files
(README.md, DOSSIER.md, the three level READMEs, and the three
results files). Tutorial commands were verified by running
them; the full suite (70 tests plus the scaffold smoke test)
passes and the Build results file stayed byte-identical across
the runners, with the Learn and Deep results files differing
only in timing fields and restored.

Jev claim_check on the blog main results claim (extracted byte
exact from fanout/blog-post.md by script): model jev-1.13.0,
822 input tokens, question id supported, noul 0.55, route
REVIEW (claim_check bands: clear at 0.85 or above, block at
0.10 or below, review between). Spec and results are in the
goal hidden_files (jev-p18-fanout-claim-spec-2026-11-05.json
and jev-p18-fanout-claim-results-2026-11-05.json).

| Repo (blog) | Blog post draft | fanout/blog-post.md, repo draft. Not posted to any blog platform. |
| Repo (tutorial) | Tutorial draft | fanout/tutorial.md, repo draft. Every command verified by running it in this cycle. |
| Repo (website) | Website page copy draft | fanout/website-page.md, copy only. No website was changed by this file. |
| LinkedIn | Post draft | fanout/linkedin-post.md, DRAFT NOT POSTED. Held: posting follows the standing platform rules; the link is carried as the first-comment line in the draft, per the LinkedIn rule. |
| Paper | Candidate brief | fanout/paper-candidate.md. Submission is Jesun's tap; nothing submitted, no venue contacted. |
| Repo (release notes) | Release notes | fanout/release-notes.md, covering v0.1, v0.5, and v1.0 with measured results and release links verified with gh release list. |
| X | Social post | Held: no post made. The loop never posts to social; drafts only under the standing platform rules. |
| Facebook | Social post | Held: no post made. Standing Facebook rule applies (no link in body or comments, keyword call to action by DM) and the loop never posts to social. |
| Instagram | Social post | Held: no post made. Standing Instagram rule applies (link in bio) and the loop never posts to social. |
| Threads | Social post | Held: awaiting Jesun's tap. Every Threads post needs his one-tap pre-approval, hash-locked on exact text and media. |
| Video | 3D playbook video | Held: flagship video production runs through the January engine queue. No video produced in this cycle. |
| Book | Book chapter | Held: chapter drafted from finished projects under the journey publishing plan; no chapter file is claimed in this cycle. |
